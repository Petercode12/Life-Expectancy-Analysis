# Programming Intergration project
Regression is one of popular task in machine learning that consists of mathematical methods
that allow data scientists to predict a continuous outcome (y) based on the value of one or more
predictor variables (x). This project discusses a traditional regression method called Lasso Regression algorithm, which is an advanced version of Linear Regression algorithm, from mathematical
perspective.

Using Lasso Regression, I have tried to analyze and build model using [Factors influencing Life Expectancy (WHO)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iZ6BAl1VBLEfQPyuGL_NUf91rNyAoriI/view) dataset from Kaggle.
